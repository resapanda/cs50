"""When texting or tweeting,
itâ€™s not uncommon to shorten words to save time or space,
as by omitting vowels, much like Twitter was originally called twttr.
In a file called twttr.py,
implement a program that prompts the user for a str of text
and then outputs that same text but with all vowels (A, E, I, O, and U) omitted,
whether inputted in uppercase or lowercase."""
